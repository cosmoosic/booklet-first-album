\begin{verse}
- All I can see -\\
All I can see we're counting the stars just 1 2 3\\
Everything exploding now there's only you and me\\
All I can see we're counting the stars just 1 2 3\\
One saying rest in peace, one for you and one for me
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- All I wanna do -\\
All I wanna do all I wanna do \\
Is stay alone with you\\
No matter what I lose no matter what they do \\
As long as I'm with you\\
x2
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- My loneliness -\\
My loneliness is killing everyone but you\\
Baby sing with me \\
One more time, one more time
\end{verse}

\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Sweet sweet honey bee \\
(Keep my sugar close to me)\\
Candy milky cream \\
(Caramel in my toffee)\\
Velvet saccharin \\
(Keep you warm and sticky here)\\
Pretty stevia leaf \\
(Baby you're so sweet to me)
\end{verse}
