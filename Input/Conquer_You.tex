\poemtitle{Conquer You}
%%
\begin{verse}
We've been up all night, on the spaceship\\
Trying to figure out, where we can head out\\
And we've been craving on some new lands\\
To put them in our palms and make them ours\\
We'll take over you, we'll be your doom (x2)
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus -\\
Where are we going now, 多少时间 until we know\\
Find a planet - conquer it, 如果有生命 get rid of it\\
我们到那里走, how long will it take until we know\\
找行星 - conquer it, and if there's life get rid of it
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Blast off in space across the place\\
With cold hearts and capes, we causin' quakes\\
I got a blackjack and of course an ace\\
For you to give me everything and that's all it takes!\\
Lookin' fresh in my new space suit, 'bout to invade in a new place too\\
Planetary raid in my new grey boots\\
And my space gun go PEW PEW PEW\\
So just hand over anything, yeah we want everything\\
Do I gotta tell you what we want? ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING!\\
So just hand over anything, yeah we want everything\\
Do I gotta tell you what we want? ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING!
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide\\
We're gonna take your planet tonight (x2)
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus -
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I wanna conquer you yeah!
\end{verse}
