\poemtitle{Escape}
%%
\begin{verse}
Around the night time\\
Street light creeping in\\
Release my arms all\\
Wrapped in cellophane
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus -\\
别想明天\\
摆动你的脚\\
感受音乐\\
仿佛没人会看到\\
x2
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Come with me move your feet \\
Like it's the last day you can do it\\
Move even if you're offbeat \\
Doesn't matter no one will see\\
Feel it in your bones\\
When you're all alone\\
When you look for the sky\\
You jump so high and almost fly\\
There's no need to stay in line\\
Just let your mind escape for once
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus -
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Counting 123 \\
Moving off my feet\\
Rhythm close to me\\
Always feeling free
\end{verse}
