\poemtitle{How June and Ru D. Met}
%%
\begin{verse}
June and Ru D. met in this place with posters everywhere\\
``The best chicken wings you'll ever taste"\\
In that big factory \\
They're clearly not sorry, for that little mistake woo whoops
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus -\\
So crispy, so happy\\
All the other wings now seem so mushy\\
So crispy, so happy\\
All the memories of this factory
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
So crispy, so happy\\
All the other wings now seem mushy\\
So crispy, so happy\\
All the memories of this factory\\
So crispy, so happy\\
You'll never taste something like this\\
So crispy, so happy\\
All because of one mad scientist
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Doctor liked to play with fire\\
Using June to kill his hunger\\
Doctor was obsessed with power\\
That's how fate brought us together
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Ru D. felt that it was a trap, when he began his mission\\
That's just what he secretly hoped, inside his boring life\\
He met with the enemy then June told her story:

\begin{verse}
Made a new gun that makes everyone\\
So crispy and fun and I made this new song\\
``빨리 \ks 빨리 \ks 빨리 \ks time to start" x2
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
So crispy, so happy\\
Ru D. fell for her music \\
She's so happy she finally\\
Stopped working for the enemy\\
So crispy so happy\\
Her gun could heal or numb somebody\\
Fandom and friendship\\
Made this genius save everybody
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Love and music exploration\\
A friendship for good reason\\
Before they went on new missions\\
That time they learned a lesson\\
x2
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Can't shoot him once, you only wanna shoot him twice\\
Can't shoot him once, you wanna go far back in time
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
- Chorus -
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
So crispy, so happy\\
You'll never taste something like this\\
So crispy, so happy\\
All because of one mad scientist
\end{verse}
