The previous two songs were written by Ru D.'s mentor and former best friend \bblu{QT5PY}, a renowned investigator for the government. No case remains unsolved with him, as long as he has access to his candy bars.

\bo{\ce{C6H12O6}} is his signature song, reuniting the two most important topics in his life: love and sugar.\\

\bo{QT5PY} is an autobiography describing a difficult time dealing with a group of criminals, affectionately called the \bblu{Cosmoose Gang}. It actually designates Ru D. and his new friends. \\

After QT5PY's device was hacked and the song demos leaked, a few anonymous singers generously volunteered to record brand new professional versions.

\bo{`Escape 感受音乐'}, the next song, will take you away from the intricate stories of the Cosmooverse. The message is about letting go and feeling free, being transported by the music.\\

\bblu{Florrie}, another fellow dissident, joins Ru D. in this dance anthem. A very skilled programmer, she is clever but naive, as she will do and sing anything for anyone claiming to be her friend.
