\bo{`Conquer You'} describes Ru D.'s typical day in the SCU, finding new lands and taking over them to satisfy Humans of the Earth.\\

But Ru D. is not the same man anymore. Fast forward to a few years later, and you will find him fighting the very ones he trusted as coworkers, as friends...\\

\textbf{`Eyes Wide Open'} explores this change, and is about rebirth and not being afraid of taking risks. But parting ways with old friends is never without sadness, pain and rage.\\

\textbf{`Die JÃ¤ger'} is about processing the old wounds, by exacting revenge and taking back control.
