\emph{\normalsize{In the Cosmooverse, the dedicated agents who investigate how to ``Maximise Happiness of Humans of the Earth" are members of an elite squad known as the Special Cosmooperations Unit (SCU). \bblu{Ru D}. was one of their agents. This is his story.}}

\bo{`Conquer You'} describes Ru D.'s typical day in the SCU, finding new lands and taking over them. This is all part of \bblu{The Government}'s long-term plan to satisfy Humans of the Earth.\\

But Ru D. is not the same man anymore. Fast forward to a few years later, and you will find him fighting against The Government and the very ones he trusted as coworkers, as friends...\\

\textbf{`Eyes Wide Open'} explores this change, and is about rebirth and not being afraid of taking risks. \\

But parting ways with old friends is never without sadness, pain and \emph{rage}.\\

\textbf{`Die JÃ¤ger'} is about processing the old wounds, by exacting revenge and taking back control.
