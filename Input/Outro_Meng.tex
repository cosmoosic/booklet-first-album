\poemtitle{Outro: Mèng 梦}
%%
We hope you enjoyed this journey into the Cosmooverse. \\

This closing song describes a curiously premonitory dream Ru D. had before meeting the current Cosmoose gang members. 

It predicted another fateful meeting with a crucial character we haven't mentioned yet.\\

\bblu{Wool} is a mysterious mechanic who uses many secret tools and techniques, and can fairly easily get out of any situation (you can imagine how he met the gang). He usually quietly stays in the background, but often saves the day.

It's time to say goodbye but don't cry! 
Admire the cuteness of the Cosmoose Gang mascot \bblu{CC}, whose story will be introduced in their next adventures!
