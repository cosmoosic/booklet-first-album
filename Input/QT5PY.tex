\begin{verse}
I'm calm like a cat waiting to strike\\
That's why they call me the sugary Cutie Spy\\
Because I look so harmless\\
But I uncover secrets\\
And you can keep your silence \\
I will still find your weakness
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I like to play with everyone\\
Even the ruthless criminals\\
I want to make them feel at home\\
So they finally reveal \\
The darkness of their soul
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
No one can hide from our Cutie Spy\\
You'll confess your crime \\
In his lullaby\\
It's no use to try a fake alibi\\
There's no time to die\\
For our Cutie Spy
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Even though I sometimes hate it\\
I still believe in second chances\\
And even though I sometimes hate him\\
Ru D. and I still share good moments
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I remember driving back from Mars\\
We celebrate the first mission he's done\\
He bought me some custom candy bars\\
He was so young but already had such wisdom
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I cannot wait for the next time we meet\\
He will be bitter and I'll be sweet\\
We will go back to our happy memories\\
Under the blooming chicken trees
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
Cosmoose gang they ain't my friends\\
One day I will catch them\\
Cosmoose Gang this is the end\\
I won't rest till I catch them
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
I'm gonna catch them all\\
C'est mon histoire\\
Ce sera ma plus grande victoire\\
Cosmoose Gang you ain't my friend\\
I'm gonna catch them all \\
Cosmoose Gang this is the end
\end{verse}
