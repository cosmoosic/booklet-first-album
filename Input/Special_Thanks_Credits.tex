This adventure would have not come to life without the existence of \href{https://indiemusicfeedback.com}{Indie Music Feedback}, led by \bbro{Pax Libertas} and \bbro{Vulpz}. So we want to thank all \bbro{IMFers} for the encouragement they offered, and for the fun they are bringing to our lives.\\

To \bbro{camoragi}, \bbro{Star Smash} and all of our \bbro{Cosmoofriends}, many thanks for building the Cosmooverse with us and making it way cooler. We are super excited about the songs, the stories, the videos that we are creating together. We can't wait to release the next collaborations!\\

We would also like to thank \bbro{Spiritreader Sam} and \bbro{Jorchime} for their expert advice on the mixing and mastering.\\

Thanks to \bbro{LockModern} for the wonderful video for `Eyes Wide Open'.\\

And if \bbro{you} are reading this part, we want to thank you personally. Most people who read the booklet will check the first and last page, but the vast majority will \emph{not open the booklet at all}. We are therefore very grateful for your interest and taking this journey Into the Cosmooverse.
